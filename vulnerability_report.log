Vulnerability Description (Thought): The vulnerability being tested here pertains to potential privilege escalation through the user creation process. The concern is that by manipulating the parameters of a POST request to an API endpoint—such as altering roles or injecting additional unauthorized fields—a user could potentially gain elevated privileges within the system. This type of vulnerability can occur if the backend improperly validates and restricts fields during user account creation, allowing certain parameters to be altered or added, which could enable unauthorized access or elevated rights.
